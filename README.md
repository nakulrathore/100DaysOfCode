#About 100DaysOfCode
Inspired by Alexander Kallaway's [Blog Post](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/start-2017-with-the-100daysofcode-improved-and-updated-18ce604b237b#.vwu7oquo6)

###Rules
1. I will code for at least an hour every day.
2. I will tweet my progress every day, with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode and note which day of the challenge Iâ€™m on.
3. I will encourage and support at least two people each day in the #100DaysOfCode challenge.
